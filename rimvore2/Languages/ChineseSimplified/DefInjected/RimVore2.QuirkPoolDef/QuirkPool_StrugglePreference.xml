  <!-- The system already supports grapple strength for attacker or defender sides with modifierName = 
    "GrappleStrengthAttacker" and "GrappleStrengthDefender" 
    but I don't know how I would implement these here and make em look good. Trait requirements already have their own special implementation, 
    which was the only reason I would have had for att/def specific quirks -->
